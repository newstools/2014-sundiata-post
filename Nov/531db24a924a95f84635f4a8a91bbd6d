Lagos- The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday rejected the allegation that its data centre in Lagos was used to clone Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). Alhaji Lai Mohammed, APC National Publicity Secretary, during a media briefing in Lagos said that the centre was only used by the party to develop the database of its members. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on Saturday, the APC in a statement alleged that its data centre in Lagos was invaded by security agents. The Department of State Service (DSS) also on Sunday said that its decision to raid the premises was as a result of a petition which alleged that some persons were using the place to clone PVCs. Mohammed, however, told newsmen:”The allegation by the DSS is wrong, nothing but getting our database went on in this place.”. He said that the invasion was aimed at destabilising the party. “I will recall that few months ago, we embarked on a nationwide membership registration exercise, in which we were able to register millions of Nigerians. “It was as a result of this that we set up six data centres, including this, across the country, where we have been inputing into our computer, database of all our members to enable us contact and broadcast to them. “And as you can see, even from the location of this office and from the activities going on here, nothing but compiling of database is going on here,” he said. Mohammed said that the centre would not be able to continue with its online and offline registration exercise as a result of the invasion and the vandalism of all its systems. “We don’t know how to clone voters’ cards; if they can come here and destroy our centre, how then do you talk about level playing ground in 2015 elections?” he queried. Mohammed said that three of the 25 officials of the centre arrested by the DSS have yet to be released. (NAN)
