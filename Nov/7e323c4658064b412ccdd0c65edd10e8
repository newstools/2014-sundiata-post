BAMAKO-A nurse at a private clinic in Bamako has become the second victim of the Ebola virus in Mali, radio reports said on Wednesday.
According to the reports, the nurse was infected by a patient from Guinea who was treated at the same clinic and has since died.
Mali has only been lightly affected by the outbreak of the deadly virus, which has infected over 10,000 people and caused nearly 5,000 deaths, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The reports say there was one other death from the virus in Mali in October in the western city of Kayes.
However, 15 people have been quarantined. (dpa/NAN)
