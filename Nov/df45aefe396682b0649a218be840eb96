YOLA – The American University of Nigeria has been given approval by the National Universities Commission (NUC) to offer PhD and MSc academic programmes in Business Administration, effective from the 2014/2015 academic session. The accreditation was conveyed to AUN in a letter dated October 29, 2014, following a resource assessment visit in August by a team of NUC officials. The letter was signed by the NUC Director, Academic Standards, Dr. G.B. Kumo, for the Executive Secretary, Prof Julius Okojie. Reacting to the accreditation, an elated President Margee Ensign said, “I am pleased to announce that AUN, only ten years old, has received approval to run its first PhD programme.” Dean of the School of Business & Entrepreneurship, Prof. Linus Osuagwu, explained that the School is fully set to commence admission into the M.Sc. and PhD programmes starting 2015. A little more than one year ago (April 2013), the NUC reassessed AUN’s human and material resources and issued it with another five-year full accreditation to all the academic programs which had been first accredited in 2008. The accredited programmes are Accounting, Business Administration, Finance, Management & Entrepreneurship, Marketing, English Language & Literature, Telecommunication & Wireless Technology, Information System, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Economics, International & Comparative Politics, and Mass Communications (Communication & Multimedia, Advertising, Print Journalism, Television/Film, Multimedia Design.)
