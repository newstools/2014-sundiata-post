 Jonathan was joined by Vice President Namadi Sambo and the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, to unveil the note during the Federal Executive Council meeting in a very brief ceremony. He listed some countries that had before now issued currencies to mark historical events to include Morocco, Russia and Costa Rica, among others. He said the new note was produced with what he described as most advanced security features in the world.‎  He recalled that commemorative N50 notes were also introduced to mark the nation’s 50th independence anniversary. Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, also commended the CBN for coming up with the notes. She specifically lauded the QRC feature on the back of the note, saying that it was a smart move that would interest the youths. The code, if scanned with iPhones or iPads, leads users to a website where the nation’s history could be accessed. The minister also raised questions on the amount the CBN would use to print the new notes and whether it would be done locally. Jonathan however said the questions would be answered when a memorandum on the issue is presented to the council. ‎
