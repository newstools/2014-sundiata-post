LAGOS – Lagos Islanders on Friday got the basketball rolling as the Youth Alive Community League prodigy, Andrew Austin, 16, shone in their victory against Customs of Lagos, 79-47. It was the team’s first match in the DStv Men’s Premier League Basketball played at the Indoor Hall of the National Stadium, Lagos. The Islanders Coach, Lateef Erinfolami, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the team’s performance was impressive. “We played very well and we deserved to win. The results we had in the four quarters showed we were more prepared than Customs. “This is the type of performance I want from my players and if they can keep the discipline, then we may end the season well. “I am also proud of Austin’s performance. It was his first game and he showed he was made for the game. “In the ten minutes he played, he competed well for the ball and showed a lot of courage for his age. “It’s a great thing for him and the club and we hope to build him up for the future’’, Erinfolami said. An elated Austin said: “I am prepared for the challenge, I did not expect to be picked so soon, but Coach Erinfolami gave me the confidence that I was good enough. “My other team members also helped me to blend properly. I am happy and ready for the challenge ahead.” The Customs Assistant Coach, Mohammed Abbah, attributed the poor performance of his team to fatigue. “The team is not yet complete. Some of our players are writing examinations in their schools. “We lacked in all departments of the game because we were not really prepared. However, it’s just the first game. We will bounce back’’, Abbah boasted. The Dodan Warriors of Lagos walked over the two times DStv Premier League champions, the Royal Hoopers of Port-Harcourt, for their absence. In the third fixtures of the day, the match between Union Bank of Lagos and Kwara Falcons was postponed following the death of Falcons player, Joseph Aduku, in auto crash. (NAN)
