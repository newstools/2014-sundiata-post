LAGOS – In a bid to enhance the growth of hockey at the grassroots, the Nigeria Hockey Federation (NHF) on Thursday expressed its commitment to enhance the proficiency of its technical officials. The Vice-President of the federation, Godswill Megwa, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that arrangements were in progress to organise seminars that would keep officials abreast of developments in the sport. “We are planning to organise another stretch of seminars that will run for a minimum of three weeks for the technical officials, who will be participating in any competition both here in Nigeria and internationally.
