KANO – Some women in purdah in Kano on Monday said the advent of online business was making it more convenient for them to undertake business transactions. They told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano that the presence of GSM and other forms of Internet business transactions were welcome developments. Malama Maryam Yakubu, a woman in purdah in Kano, said that although it was risky, she found doing business online very exciting, “because I use it to market my skills. “I consider it risky to send my money to someone I do not know, but with prayers, God is in control and I just keep faith.” [eap_ad_2] Another woman, Malama Habiba Bashir, said she found online business convenient “because through the Internet, I advertise the perfumes which I make. “My niece, who is a university undergraduate introduced me to it and I get a lot of buyers contacting me and sending their money through my niece’s bank account. “I will then send my house boy to motor parks to send the items to buyers. I have never had a problem with any of those that bought my goods and I have over 500 customers and I am happy I did.” For Malama Rahma Salisu, another respondent, she said she found online business a lucrative one in spite of being defrauded in the past. She told NAN that the benefits of doing business online far outweighed the risks. She added that “a woman advertised lace material online and I contacted her via facebook and we agreed on a price and I sent her money for two but she later claimed not to have received the money and stopped answering my calls. “This may be one case in many but overall, I think its just very convenient and its working for some people.” (NAN) [eap_ad_3]
