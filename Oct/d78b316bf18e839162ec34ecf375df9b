AKWANGA – The Minister of Information, Mr Labaran Maku, on Sunday promised to allocate over 35per cent political appointments in his administration to women if elected the governor of Nasarawa State in 2015. Maku made the pledge at the reception after his `Thanksgiving Mass’ at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, Akwanga, in Akwanga Local Government Area, Nasarawa State. He said the appointments would make women to contribute their quota to the development of the state. He said his decision to include more women if elected was informed by the significant roles played by women in the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan.

He, therefore, called on women and the people of the state to avail themselves of the upcoming distribution of permanent voter cards by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to obtain their cards. He also sympathised with the families of those that lost their loved ones and property in the crises that affected some part of the state in recent times. He promised that if he became the governor of the state in 2015 he would run an all- inclusive administration where the interests of all tribes, religions and other groups would be protected.
