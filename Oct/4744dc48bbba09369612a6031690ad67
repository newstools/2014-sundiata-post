IBADAN – Ahead of the 2015 general elections, the Yoruba Youths Congress (YYC), has advised the All Progressives’ Congress (APC) against adopting same faith presidential candidates. Mr Olalekan Hammed, National Leader of the group, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan on Friday. Hammed cautioned that fielding a Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim ticket for the presidential election could make the party less popular. He also warned that fielding same faith flag bearers could make the party lose millions of its supporters nationwide. “Presently, the party is gaining the overwhelming support of Nigerians, but if this pact (same faith) stays, those who had previously concluded to vote for the party may have a change of mind. “The party should also not give room for those trying to divide this country on the basis of religion. “For the sake of peace and unity, therefore, we urge the party to have a re-think,” he said. The group also tasked Nigerian youths to call on political parties to reserve 40 per cent of political appointments for the youths. “We, the youths, have stayed too long at the backyard of power and now we are saying things should change in our favour. “We appeal to the entire Nigerian youths to join us in the campaign and struggle towards achieving 40 per cent inclusion in the various political offices,” he said. Hammed, however, called on those yet to obtain their permanent voter’s cards (PVC) to do so immediately to enable them perform elect credible leaders of their choice. (NAN)
