ENUGU – The Director of Public Health in Enugu State, Dr Paulinus Ossai, says Nigeria’s declaration as Ebola free has proven its ability to independently handle some health challenges. Reacting to Nigeria’s certification by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as Ebola free in Enugu on Monday, Ossai said that the country had achieved a major feat. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the certification called for celebration. “You can see that without much assistance from the international community, Nigeria could win the war against the deadly Ebola disease. “It is a thing of joy for me and the entire nation. This has shown the world what we can achieve as a nation.” The director urged the citizenry to continue to maintain a clean environmental and personal hygiene so as to eradicate other diseases that could pose a serious threat to life. “It is wise for us as a nation to continue to keep and maintain environmental and personal hygiene wherever we find ourselves, so as to combat other diseases that constitute a threat to man,” Ossai said. He warned against eating bush meat and that they should, instead, endeavour to eat balanced diet. (NAN)
