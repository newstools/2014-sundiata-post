A leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lagos State, Chief Ayo Akande, has said his party will win the 2015 Presidential election if it fields Maj.-Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) and the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, as its Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates respectively. Akande said a Buhari/Fashola ticket is the best option for his party in a statement he released on Thursday. Chief Akande however noted that the Buhari/Fashola ticket idea was his personal suggestion. He also said if both persons are fielded, poverty and corruption will be reduced to the barest minimum in the country. “A Buhari/Fashola combination stands to offer lot of advantages. We all know Buhari as a man of good virtue, who did not corruptly enrich himself. The APC stands a better chance to defeat President Goodluck Jonathan who has been endorsed as the sole candidate of the PDP for the 2015 presidential election. “A Buhari/Fashola team would give the Peoples Democratic Party a good fight in the presidential elections. “The antecedents of Buhari as a military head of state in terms of war against indiscipline and corruption and Fashola’s self-discipline and accountability would give the APC the long-sought exalted seat of the president of the country,” said Akande. He also said Fashola will make a good President but if the Presidency is zoned to the North, then he would be a good Vice Presidential material to Buhari.
