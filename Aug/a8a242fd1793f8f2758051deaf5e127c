ENUGU – The Catholic Bishop of Nsukka Diocese in Enugu State, Most Rev. Godfrey Onah, has described the late Prof. Dora Akunyili as a challenge to all Nigerians.Speaking during a requiem mass in honour of the deceased at the Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu on Wednesday, Onah said Akunyili was “one who made a difference in the sea of corruption in Nigeria’’ and praised her for her brevity.He encouraged all Nigerians to emulate the character of the deceased to make a remarkable difference in the country.“While people may be singing the praises of Dora and hailing her as a heroine, I will rather want to point that she is a challenge to all of us.“She was committed to making a difference as a Christian, not minding the discouragement she got from people about the corruption in our country.“What we are doing today is much more than paying tribute; it is an expression of her faith, which she shared and is still sharing even in death,” he said.[eap_ad_2] The bishop called on Christians to live as those who believed in resurrection so as not to lose the greatest gift of God.In his vote of thanks, the husband of late Prof. Dora, Dr Chike Akunyili, appreciated all those that attended the mass to pay his late wife last respect. Akunyili described his late wife as a light to the nation and a practising Christian.“Wherever we find ourselves, let’s try and be little Dora, let us have courage to say the truth at all times to enthrone a better society,’’ Akunyili said.He donated N1 million to the Enugu Catholic Diocese for the training of seminarians in honour of his late wife, whom he said, loved making seminarians realise their goal of becoming priests.Among those who attended the mass were former Vice-President, Dr Alex Ekwueme, former Governor of the central bank, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, the Secretary to Anambra State Government, Mr Oseloka Obaze, and Enugu State Commissioner for Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Dr Jude Akubilo.[eap_ad_3]
