Nigeria’s President Goodluck Jonathan on Thursday approved the sack of doctors across federal hospitals in Nigeria. Nigerian doctors under the auspices of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) have been on an indefinite strike since July 1, demanding for improved welfare. Not even the entry of the deadly Ebola virus into Nigeria’s shores was enough to convince them to return. The federal government was of the opinion that the action of the striking doctors was contrary to the oath they swore to.

Awute, ordered that the sack of the doctors should take immediate effect. “President Goodluck Jonathan has suspended the residency training programme for doctors in Nigeria indefinitely for the purposes of appraising the challenges facing the health sector. “In line with the above, the Honourable Minister has directed that you issue letters of termination of Residency Training appointment to the affected Resident Doctors in your Hospital immediately. “The Board of Management is to take all necessary measures to immediately restore full medical services in your hospital. Note however this is without prejudice to the employment of Locum Physicians on six months renewable contract tied to productivity and good behaviour,” the letter read. [eap_ad_4]
