LAGOS – Prof. Akintunde Sowunmi, a Pharmacologist and Therapeutist at the University of Ibadan, said on Thursday that adequate and sustained education on malaria had the capacity to eliminate the disease from Nigeria. Sowunmi, who said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), decried the prevalence of malaria in the country. He said that the prevention strategies adopted so far were satisfactory and should be retained, improved and implemented holistically to yield far-reaching results. “Malaria is a killer disease; malaria is still in Nigeria; it is still one of the leading causes of fever and anaemia in Nigeria. “We need to have more knowledge about malaria, educate the people that we have to use the nets, that we have to use Anti-malaria combination therapy (ACTs) correctly and we have to treat acute infection complaints within 24 hours.
