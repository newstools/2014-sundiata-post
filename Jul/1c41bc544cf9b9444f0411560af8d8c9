LAGOS – Yeka Onka, the winner of the first Nigerian Idol music talent hunt, said she formed an all-girl music band because she wanted to encourage every girl-child to have a role model. Yeka told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos that she wanted to be unique by doing something different from what others were doing in the entertainment industry. Yeka (Onyeka Onwuka) won the ‘Nigerian Idol’ contest sponsored by one of the nation’s telecommunications outfits, Etisalat in 2011. “Unfortunately in Nigeria, they expect every tall, slim looking girl to be a model or be into fashion, but I didn’t choose music, music chose me.
