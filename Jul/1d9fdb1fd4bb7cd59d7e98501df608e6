Perhaps 2014 should be referred to as the ‘Year of the Davido’ in the Nigerian music industry. The Aye crooner keeps carting away awards like it’s nothing. Davido just won himself another African ‘Artiste of the Year’ award at the African Musik Magazine Awards recently held in Dallas, US. [eap_ad_1] David won the award over Wizkid, Flavour, Sarkodie of Ghana, Mafikizolo of South Africa and Diamond of Tanzania who were also nominated. This would make the third big award that Davido has won this year, he won the same Best African Act award at the BETs and the MTV Africa Music Awards. (Radar.ng) [eap_ad_4]
