 A former militant leader, Dokubo-Asari, alleged that the bomb attack on former Military Head of State was planned by Buhari himself. Asari, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, said Buhari and his group would fail in their conspiracy and desperation to take over power from President Goodluck Jonathan now, in 2015 or whenever. The leader of the Niger Delta Peoples Salvation Force, NDPSF, lambasted the three-time presidential aspirant for going as far as masterminding an attack that murdered scores of innocent Nigerians.[eap_ad_1] He claimed to know the Northern leader so well, saying that Buhari was not known to be driven in a bullet-proof car prior to the incident and that the use of an armoured jeep in his motorcade started recently. The former President of Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, reiterated the position of the Niger Delta region, that President Jonathan must contest in 2015. He advised opponents of the Peoples Democratic Party-led government to refrain from their consistent attacks, saying that such would not deter the current national leadership from delivering its Transformation Agenda to Nigerians.
