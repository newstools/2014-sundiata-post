African Pop Prince, Davido who is famed for releasing good tunes and  flaunting of  his wealth via social media has come out to defend the latter. The Future African Awards nominee who in the past few weeks has been blasted by fans for showing off his expensive watches and newly acquired cars via his Instagram page told Encomium magazine that he don’t actually care about what his fans think, noting that he is free to post anything he wants on his page. [eap_ad_1] “I don’t call it flaunting of wealth. It is my car, my money and it is even my page. You don’t have to follow me on instagram. You don’t have to follow me on the social media. It would have being different if I was advertising all this on a billboard. I am not doing that” he said. (Radar.ng) [eap_ad_4]
