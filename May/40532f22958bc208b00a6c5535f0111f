LAGOS – Mrs Moji Olaiya, a Nollywood actress, on Monday urged the Federal Government to support the entertainment industry by putting in place institutional structures to fight piracy. Olaiya told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that piracy had retarded the growth of the entertainment industry over the years. “Piracy is killing business and it is not helping the growth of the industry,’’ Olaiya said. She said that consumers were lamenting the poor quality of film production in the country as a result of piracy. “The poor film production is not the fault of producers but piracy has brought about low quality production. “Piracy has made things difficult for producers after spending much on the production of their films. Therefore, producers tend to manage costs in order not to lose the market,’’ she said. Olaiya urged government to assist the industry by addressing piracy in the country. “Government should support the growth of the industry and also see the sector as a major income earner, ’’she said. Olaiya noted that producers were not enjoying the industry anymore because of piracy. (NAN)
