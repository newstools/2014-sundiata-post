 The aggrieved members stormed the party secretariat on Ahmadu Bello Way with placards of various inscriptions to register their grievances. Some of the placards read: “No internal democracy in Kaduna APC”. “We resist imposition of candidates”. “We say no to imposition,” “Sule Hunkuyi go back to your PDP,” among others. They called on Gen.Muhammadu Buhari, Bola Tinubu and Bisi Akande to intervene “before it is too late”. The leader of the aggrieved members and Chairman, Kaduna State APC ward executive aspirants’ forum, Alhaji Haruna Mohammed, said the protest was to disapprove some moves to destroy the party. “We are forced to come out today in large numbers by our love for our great party, the All Progressive Congress (APC). “By not doing so, will amount to great disservice to ourselves and our great party, the APC. “We came out today to protest what we strongly believe to be a sinister and deliberate move to destroy APC in Kaduna State,” he said. Mohammed said that the protesters took the decision because of some loopholes in the ward congresses of the party which ended inconclusively. Mohammed alleged that the Ward Congress Committee had released the list of names of some candidates purportedly elected as members of executives in their wards. The leader of the protesters described the inconclusive nature of the ward congress as unfortunate and attributed the development to the activities of “fifth columnists in our party in Kaduna”. “When some states have already conducted their state congresses, Kaduna State APC is yet to finish with ward congresses. “This is because the ward congresses were deliberately sabotaged. He called on the party leadership to intervene in the crisis adding that they would go to court if their grievances were not addressed in seven days. When NAN contacted the Chairman, Interim Committee, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, he said that no result had been released for the ward congresses yet. (NAN)
