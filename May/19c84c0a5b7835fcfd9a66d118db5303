In his sermon during the funeral service at the Methodist Church Nigeria, Umueze, Amuda-Isuochi, the Archbishop of Umuahia Methodist Archdiocese, Archbishop Sunday Agwu, described death as inevitable. Agwu noted that one of the mysteries of life was the fact that no one could say when and how he would die.
