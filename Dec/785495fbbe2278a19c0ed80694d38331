ABUJA – Rose Verissimo, FCT gymnastics coach, on Monday said that the sport was not developing in the country.
Verissimo said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, while assessing the development of the game in the country.
“Gymnastics in Nigeria is facing serious problems now; we do not have equipment and the few we have, especially in the FCT, is dilapidated and outdated.
“One of the major problem confronting the development of the sport in the country is lack constant competitions, to help keep the gymnasts fit and to enable us to evaluate their performances.
“We did not have up to three national championships this year, not to talk of travelling out of the country for competitions
“If the situation continues like this, I do not see how the sport will grow in the country. This will also kill the morale and interest of athletes and their handlers,’’ Verissimo said.
The coach, however, called on the government, as well cooperate bodies, to assist in reviving the game in the country.
“The whole situation has to do with the availability of funds. We are calling on government at all levels, as well as well-meaning individuals and corporate sponsors to help to revive the game,’’ she added. (NAN)
