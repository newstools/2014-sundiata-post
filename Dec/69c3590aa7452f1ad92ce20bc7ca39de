Kano- The National President, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Malam Mohammed Garba, has cautioned politicians against acts capable of truncating the nation’s democracy. Garba gave the advice in Kano on Sunday while chatting with newsmen. “Politicians should be mindful of what they say and do, otherwise their unguarded utterances and actions may truncate our democracy. “They should also learn to accept defeat because in any contest, there must be a winner and a loser. He also urged the National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the 2015 general elections were free, fair and acceptable to all Nigerians. “INEC must ensure that the forthcoming general elections are free, fair and acceptable to all Nigerians in order to avoid a repeat of what happened after the 2011 general elections,” Garba said.

‘’We are disturbed that some of the media organisations do not give opponents or all the parties equal opportunities. ‘’The media should also be able to tell Nigerians what those politicians seeking re-election have done and the quality of those coming fresh,” he said.(NAN).
