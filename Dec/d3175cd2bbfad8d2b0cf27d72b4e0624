Abuja- The administration of President Goodluck Jonathan prides itself as the most liberal as it adheres to rule of law and tolerance.
Dr Doyin Okupe, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs, stated this in a text message to State House Correspondents in Abuja on Tuesday.
This came as a response to Tuesday’s swipe on President Goodluck Jonathan by Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Soyinka, at a news conference in Lagos, said the President was worse than ancient Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar. He said although Jonathan was democratically elected, his actions had proved that he was more of a dictator, adding that he was a President that embraced impunity. But Okupe said that “Soyinka is playing the ostrich as he has deliberately ignored people who are actually engaged in impunity. “For instance, Soyinka had failed to reprimand Gov. Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers who is the king of impunity. “Our eminent professor also sadly plays the ostrich as he failed to reprimand Amaechi who is the national champion of impunity and official recklessness.’’ (NAN)
