ABUJA – A People Democratic Party (PDP) House of Representative aspirant, Ms Aisha Osori, has denounced the PDP to join the All Progressives Congress (APC) after emerging winner under the PDP.
Osori made the announcement on Tuesday in Abuja while briefing newsmen at the APC national secretariat.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Osori emerged winner at the just concluded AMAC/Bwari federal constituency primary in the Federal Capital Territory.
Osori, who was presented with the membership card of the APC, told newsmen she decided to carpet-cross after watching the APC primary because she believed in Osibanjo, who was her lecturer at one time.
“I decided to denounce membership after watching the APC conduct its presidential primary in a fair and competitive manner and after seeing the combination of Osibanjo and Buhari, both men of integrity.
“Osibanjo used to teach me at the University of Lagos, faculty of law, I believe that is a great combination that would move the country forward and I want to be part of that team,’’ she said.
According to her, the APC slogan `Change’ is enough reason to support the party as she was sure of winning the on the platform of APC. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″]
