ABUJA – Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and Gov. Rabiu Kwankwaso of Kano State have kicked against the choice of venue for the APC presidential primary which holds on Dec. 8.
A document signed by both aspirants and obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday stated that the relocation of the primary was not convenient
Our party has paid for the Eagle Square for Dec. 7, 8, 10 and 11.
”This will enable our party to maximally harvest the fall out of PDP National Assembly primary since we have nothing to harvest from the PDP presidential primary as they have only one candidate.
”The proposed venue of Lagos is not convenient for all; we therefore advise that our party reverts to Abuja as the venue.”
NAN gathered that there had been disagreements on the choice of venue between Abuja and Lagos and the party recently chose Benin as a neutral ground for the presidential primary. (NAN)
