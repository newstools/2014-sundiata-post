LAGOS – One Love Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Producers Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN) has advised the Federal Government to build film villages to boost the entertainment industry.
Mr Debo Alexander, the Governor of the Association, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that lack of film villages in the country had impeded the growth of the industry.
He said that the inauguration of film villages would afford young artists the opportunities to exhibit their talents and creative abilities learnt in schools or on the job.
Alexander said that the Nigerian film industry had the potential to be better than Bollywood and Hollywood if there were several film villages to train young artists.
“Establishment of film villages will help to develop and boost the image of Nigeria entertainment industry.
“Most of the developing countries that produce quality movies have several film villages where they train their artists.
“The industry will grow if the government can assist in establishing film villages in the country, “ Alexander said.
He listed some countries that had film villages which assisted in developing their movie industry as India, the U.S, UK, France, Germany and Brazil.
Alexander was optimistic that if the Federal Government could establish film villages in the country, Nigeria movies will be more quality than that of it counterparts.
He also urged the government to assist practitioners in getting modern equipment to shoot movies.
“The film equipment we are using are outdated; we need modern day equipment to shoot our movies.
“There has always been clamour that the government should boost the real sector by financing it.
“The government can do that by assisting the film industry without soft loans to practitioners through the banking industry,’’ he said. (NAN)
