LAGOS – The Chairman of BEN TV, UK, Mr Alistair Soyode, said on Friday that the BEN TV Awards was designed to celebrate Nigerians in different fields of endeavour.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Awards was held on Dec. 11, at the Oriental Hotel, Lagos.
BEN TV is a popular black-oriented television outfit based in the UK, and founded by Alistair Soyode about 10 years ago.
Soyode told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the decision to confer the awards was done through a painstaking process and not impulsively.
He said that subsequent editions of the awards would hold in the UK.

“At the end of the day when we are talking about entertainment, especially movie and sport, there is no way that we can definitely say we have a good attendance of the people that we had in Nigeria in the UK.
“So for that reason, at least for the first time, we have come home to celebrate with them and on the other side, subsequent ones, we say okay guys, you come to London.
“So BEN TV indeed has come home to celebrate the people at home who may not, either because of policy, as you know, other countries have the strident policy in terms of visa requirements.
“But we have come home, made it easier, celebrated and had a good time.
“So at the end of the day we would say, wow, yes we achieved something, subsequent ones, they may come to us where they will mingle with the black community in the United Kingdom, in Europe, under one roof; celebrating the achievements of our heroes, of our icons, either from Nigeria or from the United Kingdom.’’
