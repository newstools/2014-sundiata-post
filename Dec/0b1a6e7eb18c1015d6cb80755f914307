TOKYO – Japan’s Health Ministry on Monday said a Japanese man who returned from Sierra Leone earlier this month is being tested for possible Ebola infection after he developed a fever earlier in the day.
Local media reported that the man, in his 30s, said he had no direct contact with Ebola patients but he “touched with his bare hands” a bag containing a body on Dec. 17.
The report said he stayed there for eight days through Dec. 21, adding he returned to Japan on Dec. 23 and has since stayed at home at the request of authorities.
The ministry said the man reported his condition to the health centre since his temperature had risen to 38.2 degrees Celsius on Monday and his fever dropped to 37.2 degrees Celsius.
However, the man has been hospitalised at a medical institution in Tokyo. (Xinhua/NAN)
