Lagos- The All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal House of Representatives primary in Kosofe Federal Constituency of Lagos was on Tuesday postponed for the second time following protests by some groups. Prince Austine Eweka, the electoral officer, announced the postponement after listening to all parties involved at the Kosofe Local Government Secretariat. Eweka said that the complaints of the groups would be forwarded to the party’s national headquarters for advice. “Our faithful delegates, we have listened to your complaints; what I am going to do is to send the complaint to Abuja and wait for their reply in the next 72 hours. “ We are supposed to have finished the primary election by Monday and write our reports by today. We will make the sacrifice of waiting because of only one constituency. “The list you complained about emanated from you and that same list were sent to Abuja. “This same list was used for governorship and House of Assembly primaries; you will give us some time to sort-out this issue,’’ Eweka said. Speaking earlier, the State Chairman of APC, Chief Henry Ajomale, said that the election may have to hold in a neutral place. “We are going to hold it at a neutral ground. It seems to me that this place is the problem. “This is the second time we are conducting primaries in your constituency without success,’’ he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the primary election had earlier been postponed when it was held in other areas of the state following protests by some groups. The groups claimed that one of the aspirants was favoured in the delegates’ arrangement.(NAN)
