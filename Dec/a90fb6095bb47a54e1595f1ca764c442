LAGOS – The Nigeria Powerlifting Federation (NPF) on Friday reiterated its commitment to increasing the sport’s profile in the country.
Abdulazeez Alli, President of the Federation, spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), at the venue of the ongoing National Open Powerlifting Championship at the National Stadium in Lagos.
Alli said the ongoing event was organised to create more awareness about the sport.
The Federation President said competitions would also provide a platform to grade athletes in all categories in the sport.
“The main objective of this competition is to project the sport and also to increase its level of popularity. This competition will also help us to test-run our athletes,’’ he said.
Alli, however, appealed to corporate bodies and philanthropists to support the sport by sponsoring some of its programmes.
“Lack of fund has always been a major challenge for powerlifting.
“Corporate organisations and individuals should please assist the federation in any way to promote the sport,” he said.
NAN reports that athletes from 10 states and seven clubs in the country are presently participating in the championship.
The event which began on Thursday will end on Saturday.(NAN)
