ABUJA – Prof. Attahiru Jega, Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has said the commission is working to meet its technical design needs locally through its Graphic Design Centre.
Jega made the disclosure when he spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Wednesday.
He said that INEC had started using the centre located in INEC Electoral institute, Abuja, to improve the commission’s capacity to design its’ voter education and training manuals.
The chairman said that the centre, acquired with the support of the International Federation for Electoral Systems, would help INEC to design its election materials and even the ballot paper.
“We can design and typeset it and have it camera-ready, so that all we need to do is to give it to a printer for massive printing,’’ Jega said.
Jega said that the centre was already being put into good use for producing of some of the commission’s documents, including fliers and leaflets.
He said that although the commission now had the capacity to print a few thousand copies in-house, any large order have to be printed outside the commission.
“We are expecting that virtually all our training manuals will be designed there.
“Some quantity of the documents will be actually printed at the centre, but when you are printing 100 thousands or a million documents, you have to take some of copies to bigger printer but we usually design this in-house.
“Really, INEC is happy to have the state-of-the-art centre and which has given us a lot of in-house production.
“Our training manuals, voter education leaflets and sensitisation leaflets and many of our publications are now increasingly designed from the centre,’’ he said.
Asked if the centre would be used to print ballot papers for the 2015 general elections, Jega said the commission had the capacity.
He, however, said that such a thing had to be done outside the commission because of the additional security features and millions of copies involved. (NAN)
