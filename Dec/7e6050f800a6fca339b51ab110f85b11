LAGOS – Some political scientists on Wednesday underscored the need for politicians to adhere to the ethics of competitive elections to ensure credibility of the 2015 general elections in Nigeria.
The scientists, in telephone interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said the National Orientation Agency still needed to preach value reorientation on the importance of observing election ethics by Nigerians.
Prof. Friday Iyoha of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo, said that the credibility of Nigeria’s 2015 election depended on politicians playing by the rules.
He said the credibility of the primary elections to choose candidates to contest for the elective positions in the different parties would be a good measure of how the 2015 polls would fare.
”The permutations to select party flag bearers for the available positions at the party level will be the indicator of whether we will have a violent free polls,” he said.
Similarly, Dr Ferdinard Otto of the University of Lagos, said that much more sincerity, consideration for the nation’s development and not being desperate to win at any cost was expected of politicians now.
He said Nigeria’s corporate coexistence would be enhanced if next year’s elections were legitimate.
”Our 2015 elections must be a stimulus to further improve our economy and international image,” he said.
According to Dr Adewale Yagboyaju of the University of Ibadan, Nigerian politicians should think more like statesmen than party faithfuls in 2015 and beyond.
”The history of elections in this country is the pastoral story that our politicians must learn from and imbibe the morals they need not to repeat the mistakes of the past.(NAN)
