BENIN – Security was beefed up on Saturday at Afuze, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo as the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) held its House of Representatives primaries ahead of 2015 elections.
The winner of the primaries will fly the PDP flag for Owan East and Owan West Federal Constituency in the National Assembly.
Security team comprising the Police, State Security Service, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Army were seen at strategic places in the area.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the security operatives declined comments but said “we are on standby to forestall any breakdown of law and order.
“We want to ensure violent-free primaries,’’ they told NAN.
The NAN reports that there was also large turnout of delegates at Pa Michael Imoudu Institute of Physical Education venue of the exercise as early as 7a.m.
Accreditation of delegates, however, started at 1.10p.m., but no reason was given for the late accreditation.

The others were Job Oikeh, Dan Asekhame, Tanko Ileoghen from the Owan West Local Government and Ambrose Imoodu from Owan East Local Government Area. (NAN)
