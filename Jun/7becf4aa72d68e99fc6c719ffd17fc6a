ABUJA -Diamond Music Entertainment, an Abuja-based outfit on Wednesday expressed optimism of producing a star in its talent hunt audition. The Chief Executive Officer of the outfit, Julietta Ofuyeta, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sideline of the auditioning in collaboration with the French Institute in Abuja. Ofuyeta said the FCT was yet to produce a star or famous artists in most musical auditions and competitions organised for young artists across the country. She said this had informed the collaboration with the French Institute as a platform that would bring out talents in youths. “This will enable them not only becoming outstanding superstars in the Nigeria but also competing with the outside world. The chief executive officer said the audition, the second in the series, would put Abuja on the limelight with the winner performing at the World Music Day scheduled for June 21. She explained further that subsequent auditions would not be limited to music, adding that drama, dance and other exhibitions would be included. Some of the participants, who spoke with NAN, commended the organisers, stressing that it was a right step in the right direction. . Henry Abbey, 26, auditioned for rapping and singing, said that a win would boost his confidence and spurs him to pursue his career. “I have faith that I will make it because I just concluded my music scholarship programme sponsored by SURE-P,” Abbey said. Another contestant, Stephanie Arnard, 19, expressed gratitude to her mother for encouraging her to participate. Also, Solomon Abbas, 22, awaiting admission into the University, said he intends to combine both his music career and education, when he eventually gains admission. Abbas advised his fellow participants and youths to acquire more knowledge; read books, learn more lyrics and ask questions. (NAN)
