BIRNIN KEBBI – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kebbi State says it will not extend the collection of voter cards and registration of eligible voters which ended on Tuesday, June 3 in the state. Abdullahi Kebbe, the commission’s Public Relations Officer in the state, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Birnin Kebbi. He however said that those who were yet to register should do so at the commission’s local government offices where the exercise would continue. Kebbe dismissed claims that permanent voter cards that were not collected by their owners would be left in the custody of traditional leaders and councillors. “The information has no basis. INEC officials in the local government areas will issue the permanent voters cards to only duly registered voters,” he said. (NAN
