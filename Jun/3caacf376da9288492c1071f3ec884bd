Governors from the South-East have said that President Goodluck Jonathan is under pressure to tackle the challenges posed by the Boko Haram sect. The governors in attendance included those of Anambra, Enugu, Abia and Ebonyi states. Governor of Anambra state, Dr. Willie Obiano, who spoke on behalf of the governors, made this known yesterday at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, after a meeting between the governors and President Jonathan. “The President is a human being and he is under a lot of pressure. Some other people are making the work a lot more difficult for him. Instead of supporting him to steer us out of these stormy waters, they are adding kerosene to fire. So, we are here to tell him that we are supporting him and that he should count on us”, the governor said. Obiano also said that the sect could not get to the South-East as they (the governors) were very alert and were watching what was going on. The governor was apparently reacting to the reports that police on Sunday uncovered three improvised explosive devices planted in church in Owerri, the Imo state capital. He said, “No, they cannot get there; I can assure you of that. We will not allow that to happen. I cannot tell you in any material details about the bombs found or not found. All I can assure you is that we are very alert in the South-East and we are watching what is going on. I can assure you that Boko Haram cannot come to the Southeast”.
