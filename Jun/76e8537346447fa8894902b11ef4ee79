ABUJA – The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Wednesday in Abuja announced the redeployment of its deputy governors. A statement by the bank made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said that the governor of the bank, Mr Godwin Emefiele, had approved the exercise. According to the statement by Mr Isaac Okoroafor of CBN’s Corporate Communication Department, the redeployment is in line with the new governor’s vision of entrenching a more professional and people-focused Central Bank. “With the new changes, Alhaji Suleiman Barau, Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Directorate is now the Deputy Governor, Operations Directorate. “Dr Kingsley Moghalu currently the Deputy Governor, Operations, returns to the Financial Systems Stability (FSS) Directorate,” it said. It added that Mr Adebayo Adelabu, who was in charge of Financial Systems Stability (FSS) had become Deputy Governor, Corporate Services. The statement, however, said that Dr Sarah Alade, who acted as governor of the bank from March to June 2 when Emefiele assumed office, retained her position as Deputy Governor, Economic Policy Directorate. It said that the redeployments would take effect from June 23, 2014. According to the bank, the re-shuffling is expected to contribute to the bank’s vision of being the model central bank, delivering price and financial system stability and promoting sustainable economic development.
