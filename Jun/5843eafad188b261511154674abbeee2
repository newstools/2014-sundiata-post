BENIN –  Godwin Izilein, former Coach of Golden Eaglets and Super Falcons, says Nigeria has a team that can go far in the World Cup if they can overcome their stage freight. The coach said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin after Nigeria drew Iran in their first game in the ongoing 2014 World Cup in Brazil on Monday. He said though result of the game against the Iranian team was not what was expected, Nigerians should congratulate themselves for not losing. He said the result gave the country better opportunity to prepare well against the Bosnia team. Izilein noted that all the Super Eagles players needed was to overcome their stage freight and play a purposeful football against the Bosnians. “If we had lost the match, it would have been a different ball game. “Though the result is not what we expected, I am optimistic that we have a team that will go far for us. “Because majority of the boys are playing in this stage for the first, they had this problem of stage freight. “All we need before the next game is a psycologist to work on them,” he said. The former Golden Eaglets coach, however, faulted the replacement of Victor Moses for Shola Ameobi. According to him: “I feel it would have been wise if Azeez, who was lost in the game, was replaced and leave Moses to run down the Iranians who our players could not contest all aerial balls thrown in their area with. “Perhaps the coach knows better but I am also happy that Vincent Eyeama is still himself.” Nigeria is in a group that also involves Bosnia and Argentina. Argentina on Sunday defeated Bosnia 2-1 in the first game of the group. Nigeria’s next game will be against Bosnia while Argentina takes on the Iranians. (NAN)
