Veteran Nollywood actress, Rita Edochie, has spoken the minds of many people about Mercy Johnson currently towering above other actresses in the movie industry. She said that Mama Purity has no equal.
In an interview recently, Rita, who has been in the industry for a long time and should know, said that Mercy is her role model and a true Africa Queen.
Hear what she said:
My role model is Mercy Johnson; that is my African Queen.
Of all the girls in Nollywood, she is the person I love most because she is natural to a fault.
She can fit in anything. She is over natural and I like her because she does it well anytime, any day. I give it to her.
After Mercy Johnson, Chioma Chukwuka, Ini Edo, Genevieve. You see all these girls, they are all good but of all the girls, Mercy Johnson is still the best.
Apart from being one of the best actresses around, Mercy Johnson is actually the busiest at the moment.
