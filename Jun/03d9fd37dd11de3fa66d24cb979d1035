LAGOS – One of the nation’s foremost designers, Frank Osodi, on Thursday criticised the dress sense of some artistes in the entertainment sector,  saying that it was often at variance with their outings. Osodi told the News Agency Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that as public figures, they should strive to uphold values that could impact positively on budding artistes, through the way they dressed. “We need to know the events we go for. We have to know what makes up our skin colour. Where you are going to matters as well, what the event is for, as well as if there is need to be subtle. “You need to know the event you are going for, is it during the day? Day events can’t go with sequence, except like a celebrity indoor event and award events, to make you look classy. “Look at your skin colour and pick tones of colours that can enhance the skin as certain colours project and speak about the skin.’’ he said. Osodi, therefore, advised that every woman should know her statistics, especially those endowed with certain extra skin in some parts of the body, and strive to dress the body the way it should be. “Every woman should know how to dress right to fit the body figure and avoid showing off some parts of the body excessively, pointing out that it may not necessarily speak well if it doesn’t fit well on the body,’’ he said. Osodi urged female artistes with a deep interest in fashion to always consult with their designers ahead of time, to avoid disappointment and a poor dress for a movie premiere. Osodi designed the dress Agbani Darego wore when she won the 2001 edition of the Miss World pageant. (NAN)
