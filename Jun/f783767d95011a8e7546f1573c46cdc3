LAGOS – Mr Eze Uzoamaka of Formenich West Africa Ltd on Friday expressed satisfaction with the performance of the 17 students of Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), who bagged the company’s scholarship awards. Uzoamaka, Formenich’s Country Director, lauded the performance of the students at the presentation of the awards in Lagos, describing them as outstanding. He said the company was proud to have a relationship with the foremost College of Technology in Nigeria, adding that the beneficiaries were selected from 13 departments in the institution. The director said three of the awards were based on the Cumulative Grade Points of the students in the 2012/2013 academic session. According to him, the other 14 are  a buildup on a 2011 agreement between the organisation and the college. “It is an honour to enter into this relationship with the college since 2011. “Each of the awardees will receive N100, 000 while the best award winner will visit the Africa headquarters of the Geneva-based organisation in South Africa.’’ Uzoamaka said the award was restricted to the Higher National Diploma 1 (HND 1) students, to encourage the beneficiaries to study and enjoy the scholarship while in the college. He said the award was also to motivate other students to aim high and to be thorough. Earlier, the Rector of the College, Dr Margaret Ladipo, said the scholarship was part of the efforts of the institution’s management to ensure that YABATECH graduates continued to excel in technological education in Nigeria. Ladipo commended the company for sharing the vision of the college and for nurturing the products of the institution. She said the collaboration between both parties would be long-lasting and beneficial to the students. (NAN)
