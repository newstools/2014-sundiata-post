By Agency Reporter The American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced on Wednesday that a patient being treated at a Dallas, Texas, hospital is the first case of Ebola virus diagnosed in the United States. The patient, who is being kept in isolation, was suspected of having the disease based on symptoms and travel history, the hospital, Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas, said in a statement earlier today. The Dallas patient was being kept in isolation while medical officials awaited word from the CDC, the hospital said. Another suspected case was being evaluated at a National Institutes of Health facility, U.S. officials said.

The outbreak there has infected 6,574 and killed 3,091 people so far, according to the CDC. U.S. public health officials have been isolating and testing travelers who returned from the region with symptoms of the disease. The latest cases come after at least three American aid workers who were diagnosed with Ebola in Africa were evacuated to U.S. hospitals, treated and discharged. Twelve other patients were previously tested in the U.S., the CDC said. [eap_ad_4]
