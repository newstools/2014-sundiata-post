ABUJA – Some entertainment industry stakeholders on Tuesday applauded Nigerian artistes for promoting local music and the entertainment industry in general across the world through their works. A music analyst, Mr Stanley Bantu, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, observed that in spite of the lack of support, Nigerian artistes had been rewarded with distinctive awards across Western countries and beyond this year. “It is a thing of pride for us as Nigerians to be identified with a positive global success rather than being seen as a terrorist country. “It is gladding that we are doing better and excellently well in other areas of life,” Bantu said.

Onwuka, who is also a dance artiste, noted that most of her colleagues combined Nigerian cultural dance steps into theirs, thereby promoting the country’s cultural heritage. Similarly, Mr Kenneth Chukwu, an upcoming artist, told NAN that he was impressed with the growth of the music industry. “I am bound to make it with all that I am seeing in the industry. I see a lot of people that challenge me with their skills and success in the entertainment world. “I am extremely focused and determined in the pursuit of my musical career and with God, I know I can make it like other Nigerian artistes. “I will get to the top like Tiwa Savage, Bovi, Davido and many others,’’ he said. NAN reports that one of the awards in 2014 which brought Nigeria’s name to the fore globally is the African Music Magazine Award (AFRIMMA) held Dallas, U.S.. Others are the Nigeria Entertainment Awards (NEA) held in New York and the MTV-European Music Awards (EMA), Glasgow, Scotland. (NAN) [eap_ad_4]
