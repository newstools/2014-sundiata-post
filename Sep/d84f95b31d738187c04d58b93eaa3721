SHANGHAI – Former President of U.S., Jimmy Carter, on Tuesday said China’s development was no threat to the United States and that peaceful competition between the two would benefit the world economy. Carter made the remarks while addressing the 8th Barnett-Oksenberg Lecture on Sino-American relations in Shanghai. He said that the official establishment of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations 35 years ago had brought enormous benefits to people in the two countries and made the seven billion people in the whole world live a better life.
