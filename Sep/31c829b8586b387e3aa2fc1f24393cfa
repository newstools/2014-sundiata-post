The Rivers Government on Monday warned that it would shut down any primary or secondary school without pipe borne water. Miss Alice Nemi, the State Commissioner for Education, gave the warning in Port Harcourt during a sensitisation workshop for teachers in the state on Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the workshop was jointly organised by the state ministries of education and health for teachers in public and private schools. The commissioner said that potable water would ensure that the teachers, pupils and students washed their hands regularly with soap.[eap_ad_2] Nemi, however, did not say when inspection of the schools would start to know schools without the facility. NAN reports that regular hand washing and avoidance of body contact are essential to prevent the spread of Ebola virus. Dr Dora Era, a member of Ebola Emergency Response Committee (EERC) in Rivers, said that the Infra Red Thermometer was being used to check temperature of persons entering the state. She said that many victims of Ebola virus were health workers and that many Liberians died because health workers did not handle the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) properly. The proper ways to wash hands and use the PPE were demonstrated to participants. A participant, who spoke to NAN on condition of anonymity, said that although the workshop was not properly organised, teachers had known the basic things in any outbreak in school environment. The participant said that he was now better informed than ever about Ebola. [eap_ad_3]
