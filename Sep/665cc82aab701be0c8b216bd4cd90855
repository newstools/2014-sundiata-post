The war between pop acts, Wizkid and Davido may not be ending soon as the two have at different times insinuated in their interviews and constant subliminal insults traded via the social media. Their rivalry may well be more than their musical craeers as they have both shown that they have the same taste in fashion. Davido, currently in London for the Africa Unplugged show, recently showed off his pair of the Maison Martin Margiela sneakers which Wizkid wore a few months ago while in the US.
