He said that the would continue to challenge the matter in court. The National Conscience Party (NCP) also took the same position that the polls were illegal. The state Chairman of the party, Alhaji Abdulmumini Sani, also told NAN that the voters’ register was not updated before the election. He said that as a registered political party in Nigeria, NCP was not given enough time to prepare for the elections as it was only consulted on the closing date for submission  of names of candidates to the commission. Sani said the party was ready to take legal action on the issue to avoid future reoccurrence. (NAN) [eap_ad_4]
