By Nwaorgu Faustinus The All Progressives Congress (APC), Rivers State Chapter, has chided the President Goodluck Jonathan administration, describing it as an agent of darkness. Rivers APC said in a statement issued Thursday in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State, by its Chairman, Dr. Davies Ibiamu Ikanya  said, “it is a big shame that despite endless promises of improved power supply and billions of naira sunk into the purported power reform programme of the Jonathan administration, the power situation in the country today is worse than ever,” The party made reference to a new report by the international sustainable energy charity, Ashden, which showed that Nigeria has the highest number of citizens without electricity in Africa, accounting for about 10 per cent of the total 1.3 billion people in Africa who are without electricity.

Nigerians, however, do not have to continue to wallow in darkness as they have a golden opportunity to vote out this agent of darkness during the 2015 elections and cast their vote for an APC Presidency, which will end this evil covenant with darkness and give Nigerians stable power supply as obtains in other progressive societies of the world.” [eap_ad_4]
