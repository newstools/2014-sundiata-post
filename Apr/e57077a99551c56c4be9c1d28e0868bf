BENIN – The Edo Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed its local government congress scheduled for Saturday. The party’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Godwin Erhahon, disclosed told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Benin. Erhahon the postponement was due to the non-conclusion of the state’s ward congress. The spokesman, who did give the new date fixed for the local government congress, however, said that the outstanding ward congresses would be concluded on Saturday. “You will recall that we have some issues with the ward congresses conducted on Tuesday. “This reason necessitated the cancellation of the congress in Edo South senatorial district and it is upon conclusion of the congress that the local government congress will hold. “It became imperative for us to postpone because it is the ward delegates that will elect the local government delegates. “Though no date has been fixed for the local government congress, but I can assure you it will be soon,” he stated. The ward congresses in the state earlier scheduled for Saturday, April 5  were postponed till Tuesday, April 9. There were complaints of violence and non-compliance with the guidelines for conducting the congresses, especially in Edo South senatorial district. The complaints led to the cancellation of the ward congress in the senatorial district by the party on Thursday. (NAN)
